So let's start by creating a vite project
> `npm create vite@latest`

*Create a fb.config.ts file for your own project*
like this
```typescript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app"
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth"
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore"
import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage"
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics"

const firebaseConfig = {} // your configuration object 

export const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
export const auth = getAuth(app)
export const fireStore = getFirestore(app)
export const storage = getStorage(app)
export const analytics = getAnalytics(app)
```
